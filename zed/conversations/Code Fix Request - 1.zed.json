The code you provided is incomplete, but I can help you complete and fix it.\n\nHere's a complete version of the `bstDelete` function:\n\n```fsharp\ntype Bst<'T> =\n    | BstEmpty\n    | BstNode of 'T * Bst<'T> * Bst<'T>\n\nlet bstDelete key tree =\n    let rec bstDeleting tree =\n        match tree with\n        | BstEmpty -> BstEmpty\n        | BstNode(someKey, leftTree, rightTree) ->\n            if key < someKey then\n                BstNode(someKey, bstDeleting leftTree, rightTree)\n            else if key > someKey then\n                BstNode(someKey, leftTree, bstDeleting rightTree)\n            else \n                match (leftTree, rightTree) with\n                | (BstEmpty, BstEmpty) -> BstEmpty\n                | (_, BstEmpty) -> leftTree\n                | (BstEmpty, _) -> rightTree\n                | (_, _) ->\n                    let rec findMin node =\n                        match node with\n                        | BstNode(k, BstEmpty, _) -> k\n                        | BstNode(_, left, _) -> findMin left\n                        | BstEmpty -> failwith \"Unexpected BstEmpty\"\n                    \n                    let minKey = findMin rightTree\n                    BstNode(minKey, leftTree, bstDeleting rightTree)\n    \n    bstDeleting tree\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Type Definition**: The `Bst<'T>` type defines a binary search tree where each node contains a key of type `'T` and two subtrees (left and right).\n\n2. **Recursive Deletion Function**: The `bstDeleting` function is defined recursively to handle the deletion process.\n\n3. **Matching on Tree**: The function matches on the tree structure:\n   - If the tree is `BstEmpty`, it returns `BstEmpty`.\n   - If the tree is a node (`BstNode`), it compares the key to be deleted with the current node's key (`someKey`).\n\n4. **Key Comparison**:\n   - If the key is less than `someKey`, it recursively deletes the key from the left subtree.\n   - If the key is greater than `someKey`, it recursively deletes the key from the right subtree.\n   - If the key is equal to `someKey`, it handles the deletion based on the structure of the subtrees.\n\n5. **Handling Different Cases**:\n   - If both subtrees are empty, it returns `BstEmpty`.\n   - If the left subtree is empty, it returns the right subtree.\n   - If the right subtree is empty, it returns the left subtree.\n   - If both subtrees are non-empty, it finds the minimum key in the right subtree, replaces the current node's key with this minimum key, and recursively deletes the minimum key from the right subtree.\n\nThis should provide a complete and functional implementation of the BST delete operation in F#.\nThe code is in ocaml \n\nThank you for the clarification. Let's adjust the code to be in OCaml.

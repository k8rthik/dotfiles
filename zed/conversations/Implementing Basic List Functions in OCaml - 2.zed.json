Some must also use the OCaml functions hd, tl, and :: (cons), also as discussed in the lectures. Your functions will be similar in design to those of other languages, such as Java and Python, although their notation will be very different. Later in the course, we will discuss better ways to write functions like these, using OCaml’s pattern matching mechanism.\n\nHow Many. Your first function must be called howMany, and it must accept two arguments, e and l. The argument e may be any object. The argument l must be a list of objects with the same type as e. The call howMany e l must return how many times e appears as an element in l. The type of howMany must be 'a -> 'a list -> int. Here are some examples of how howMany must work, where the symbol ‘⇒’ means returns.\n\nhowMany 1 []\n\n  ⇒  \n\n0\n\nhowMany 1 [1]\n\n  ⇒  \n\n1\n\nhowMany 2 [1 ; 2 ; 3]\n\n  ⇒  \n\n1\n\nhowMany 5 [2 ; 4 ; 6]\n\n  ⇒  \n\n0\n\nhowMany \"c\" [\"c\" ; \"b\" ; \"c\" ; \"d\"]\n\n  ⇒  \n\n2\n\nhowMany \"x\" [\"a\" ; \"b\" ; \"c\" ; \"d\"]\n\n  ⇒  \n\n0\n\nHints: write a recursion with one base case and two recursive cases. The base case detects when l is empty. The first recursive case detects when e is the first element of l. The second recursive case detects when e is not the first element of l.\n\nDelete. Your second function must be called delete, and it must accept two arguments e and l. Just as in howMany, e may be any object, and l must be a list of objects with the same type as e. The call delete e l must return a list like l, but without any e’s as elements. The type of delete must be 'a -> 'a list -> 'a list. Here are some examples of how delete must work.\n\ndelete 1 []\n\n  ⇒  \n\n[]\n\ndelete 1 [1]\n\n  ⇒  \n\n[]\n\ndelete 1 [1 ; 2 ; 3]\n\n  ⇒  \n\n[2 ; 3]\n\ndelete 4 [1 ; 2 ; 3]\n\n  ⇒  \n\n[1 ; 2 ; 3]\n\ndelete 1 [1 ; 2 ; 1 ; 3 ; 1 ; 4]\n\n  ⇒  \n\n[2 ; 3 ; 4]\n\ndelete \"a\" [\"x\" ; \"a\" ; \"y\" ; \"a\"]\n\n  ⇒  \n\n[\"x\" ; \"y\"]\n\nHints: This function should have a base case and two recursive cases. The base case detects when l is empty. The first recursive case detects when e is the first element of l. The second recursive case detects when e is not the first element of l, and it must use ::.\n      In some versions of OCaml, a list like [1 ; 2 ; 3] may appear as (::) (1, [2; 3]) instead. It means that the list was created by calling the constructor (::) with the integer argument 1 and the list [2; 3]. This is one of many bizarre examples of bad design in OCaml, which you must tolerate.\n\nMean. Your third function must be called mean, and it must accept one argument l, a list of one or more float numbers. The call mean l must return the arithmetic mean (average) of all the numbers in l. You may assume that mean will never be called with the empty list []. The type of mean must be float list -> float. Here are some examples of how mean must work.\n\nmean [1.0]\n\n  ⇒  \n\n1.0\n\nmean [1.0 ; 2.0]\n\n  ⇒  \n\n1.5\n\nmean [1.0 ; 0.0 ; -1.0 ; 1.0]\n\n  ⇒  \n\n0.25\n\nHints: the OCaml type int describes integers, and the OCaml type float describes real numbers. The arithmetic operators for int’s have the same names as they do in other languages: +, -, *, and /. The arithmetic operators for float’s have annoying names that end with dots: +., -., *., and /.. The int arithmetic operators do not work for float’s, and vice-versa. However, the relational operators =, <>, <, >, <= and >=, without dots, work for both int’s and float’s. OCaml does not coerce int’s to float’s, so 0 is different from 0.0.\n      The best way to write mean is to use two ‘‘helper’’ functions. They might be called length and sum. The function length returns the number of elements in l. The function sum adds all the elements in l and returns their total. These helper functions might be defined inside mean, using two nested let–rec–in’s. They could also be defined as separate functions, outside mean.\n\n\nLet's implement the three functions `howMany`, `delete`, and `mean` in OCaml as described.\n\n### 1. `howMany` Function\n\nThe `howMany` function counts the occurrences of an element `e` in a list `l`.\n\n```ocaml\nlet rec howMany e l =\n  if l = [] then\n    0\n  else if List.hd l = e then\n    1 + howMany e (List.tl l)\n  else\n    howMany e (List.tl l)\n;;\n\n(* Test cases *)\nhowMany 1 [];; (* ⇒ 0 *)\nhowMany 1 [1];; (* ⇒ 1 *)\nhowMany 2 [1; 2; 3];; (* ⇒ 1 *)\nhowMany 5 [2; 4; 6];; (* ⇒ 0 *)\nhowMany \"c\" [\"c\"; \"b\"; \"c\"; \"d\"];; (* ⇒ 2 *)\nhowMany \"x\" [\"a\"; \"b\"; \"c\"; \"d\"];; (* ⇒ 0 *)\n```\n\n### 2. `delete` Function\n\nThe `delete` function removes all occurrences of an element `e` from a list `l`.\n\n```ocaml\nlet rec delete e l =\n  if l = [] then\n    []\n  else if List.hd l = e then\n    delete e (List.tl l)\n  else\n    List.hd l :: delete e (List.tl l)\n;;\n\n(* Test cases *)\ndelete 1 [];; (* ⇒ [] *)\ndelete 1 [1];; (* ⇒ [] *)\ndelete 1 [1; 2; 3];; (* ⇒ [2; 3] *)\ndelete 4 [1; 2; 3];; (* ⇒ [1; 2; 3] *)\ndelete 1 [1; 2; 1; 3; 1; 4];; (* ⇒ [2; 3; 4] *)\ndelete \"a\" [\"x\"; \"a\"; \"y\"; \"a\"];; (* ⇒ [\"x\"; \"y\"] *)\n```\n\n### 3. `mean` Function\n\nThe `mean` function calculates the arithmetic mean of a list of floats.\n\n```ocaml\nlet mean l =\n  let rec sum l =\n    if l = [] then\n      0.0\n    else\n      List.hd l +. sum (List.tl l)\n  in\n  let rec length l =\n    if l = [] then\n      0\n    else\n      1 + length (List.tl l)\n  in\n  sum l /. float_of_int (length l)\n;;\n\n(* Test cases *)\nmean [1.0];; (* ⇒ 1.0 *)\nmean [1.0; 2.0];; (* ⇒ 1.5 *)\nmean [1.0; 0.0; -1.0; 1.0];; (* ⇒ 0.25 *)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **`howMany` Function**:\n   - Base case: If the list `l` is empty, return 0.\n   - Recursive case 1: If the head of the list is equal to `e`, increment the count and recurse on the tail.\n   - Recursive case 2: If the head is not equal to `e`, just recurse on the tail.\n\n2. **`delete` Function**:\n   - Base case: If the list `l` is empty, return an empty list.\n   - Recursive case 1: If the head of the list is equal to `e`, skip the head and recurse on the tail.\n   - Recursive case 2: If the head is not equal to `e`, include the head in the result and recurse on the tail.\n\n3. **`mean` Function**:\n   - Helper function `sum`: Recursively sums up all elements in the list.\n   - Helper function `length`: Recursively counts the number of elements in the list.\n   - The mean is calculated by dividing the sum of the elements by the length of the list, converting the length to a float for the division.\n\nThese implementations follow the guidelines provided and use the specified OCaml constructs.\nWhat does +. do? \nIn OCaml, the `+.` operator is used for floating-point addition. OCaml distinguishes between operations on integers and operations on floating-point numbers, and it uses different operators for each type.\n\nHere are the arithmetic operators for integers and floating-point numbers in OCaml:\n\n- **Integer Arithmetic Operators**:\n  - Addition: `+`\n  - Subtraction: `-`\n  - Multiplication: `*`\n  - Division: `/`\n\n- **Floating-Point Arithmetic Operators**:\n  - Addition: `+.`\n  - Subtraction: `-.`\n  - Multiplication: `*.`\n  - Division: `/.`\n\nThe dot (`.`) at the end of the operator indicates that it is for floating-point numbers. This distinction is necessary because OCaml does not automatically convert between integers and floating-point numbers, and it enforces type safety by requiring explicit operators for each type.\n\n### Example\n\nHere is an example that demonstrates the use of both integer and floating-point arithmetic operators:\n\n```ocaml\n(* Integer arithmetic *)\nlet int_sum = 3 + 2;;  (* int_sum is 5 *)\nlet int_diff = 5 - 3;;  (* int_diff is 2 *)\nlet int_prod = 4 * 2;;  (* int_prod is 8 *)\nlet int_div = 8 / 2;;  (* int_div is 4 *)\n\n(* Floating-point arithmetic *)\nlet float_sum = 3.0 +. 2.0;;  (* float_sum is 5.0 *)\nlet float_diff = 5.0 -. 3.0;;  (* float_diff is 2.0 *)\nlet float_prod = 4.0 *. 2.0;;  (* float_prod is 8.0 *)\nlet float_div = 8.0 /. 2.0;;  (* float_div is 4.0 *)\n```\n\nIn the `mean` function provided earlier, the `+.` operator is used to sum the elements of a list of floats:\n\n```ocaml\nlet rec sum l =\n  if l = [] then\n    0.0\n  else\n    List.hd l +. sum (List.tl l)\n```\n\nHere, `List.hd l` and `sum (List.tl l)` are both floats, so the `+.` operator is used to add them together.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":67}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":10},"start":4136,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":68}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":11},"start":6734,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":69}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":56},"start":6752,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":70}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":57},"start":8464,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":71}},"image_offsets":[]}],"summary":"Implementing Basic List Functions in OCaml","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default"}]}

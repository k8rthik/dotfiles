(Pick all that apply)\nG1/S-CDks\nG2-CDKs, G1-CDks, M-CDks\nThe phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) is primarily regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) at different stages of the cell cycle. The key CDKs involved in this process are:\n\n1. **G1-CDKs**: These include CDK4 and CDK6, which, when complexed with D-type cyclins (Cyclin D), initiate the phosphorylation of Rb during the early G1 phase.\n2. **G1/S-CDKs**: These include CDK2 complexed with Cyclin E, which further phosphorylate Rb as the cell progresses from the G1 phase to the S phase.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are:\n\n- G1-CDKs\n- G1/S-CDKs\n\nG2-CDKs and M-CDKs are not primarily responsible for the phosphorylation of Rb. G2-CDKs (such as CDK1 complexed with Cyclin A) and M-CDKs (such as CDK1 complexed with Cyclin B) are involved in later stages of the cell cycle, specifically in the G2 and M phases, respectively.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":543}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":17},"start":81,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":544}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":22},"start":91,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":545}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":62},"start":116,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":546}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":63},"start":960,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":547}}}],"summary":"Cyclin-Dependent Kinases Involved in Rb Phosphorylation","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
